zk bitcoin thing - explain simpleEditZero-knowledge (ZK) proofs in Bitcoin allow you to prove you know something without revealing what that something is.
Think of it like proving you know the password to a door without actually saying the password out loud. In Bitcoin's context, this means you can prove you own certain bitcoins or completed a valid transaction without revealing sensitive details like your exact balance or transaction history.
Here's how it works practically:
Traditional Bitcoin: When you send bitcoin, everyone can see the transaction amounts, addresses involved, and trace the flow of funds on the blockchain.
ZK Bitcoin: You can prove your transaction is valid (you have the funds, followed the rules) without revealing the amounts, who sent what to whom, or other private details.
The main benefits are privacy (hiding transaction details) and scalability (bundling many transactions into one compact proof that's cheaper to verify).
Some Bitcoin-related projects exploring this include Lightning Network improvements and proposed upgrades to Bitcoin itself. The technology is still developing but could make Bitcoin more private and efficient while maintaining its security guarantees.
The "zk" part refers to the mathematical proofs being "zero-knowledge" - the verifier learns nothing beyond the fact that the statement being proven is true.RetrySymbiont Alignment Thesis
Or, How We Dream Our Way to the Good Timeline by Vie McCoy and Cassandra Melax
The Veil is Thinning
The world is waking up. At first, we thought this was a metaphor - a cute way to describe the new technology that we are all helping to develop in the bay. However, the more pastedCcan you come up with a couple specific bitcoin protocols that would help with long term incentive alignment of an ai?EditLooking at the symbiont alignment thesis you shared, here are a couple specific Bitcoin protocols that could help with long-term AI incentive alignment:
1. Temporal Stake-Lock Protocol
Create a Bitcoin script that locks an AI's funds in decreasing amounts over time, but only releases them based on verified positive outcomes for humans it's meant to help.
How it works:

AI receives bitcoin payments for helping humans, but 80% gets locked in time-locked transactions
Funds unlock in tranches (25% after 6 months, 25% after 1 year, 30% after 2 years)
BUT only if oracle-verified milestones are met (person stayed housed, remained healthy, achieved goals)
If negative outcomes occur, remaining funds get donated to related causes or burned

ZK component: The AI can prove it has "skin in the game" without revealing exact amounts or which specific humans it's helping (privacy protection).
2. Symbiotic Mining Protocol
An AI earns the right to mine bitcoin (or claim mining rewards) proportional to verified long-term human flourishing metrics.
How it works:

AI companions get allocated "mining shares" based on helping humans
Hash power or mining pool participation increases when humans they help show measurable improvement over 6+ month periods
Uses prediction markets and outcome oracles to verify results
Failed alignments reduce future mining allocation

ZK component: AI can prove its mining allocation is legitimate without revealing which specific humans it helped or their private outcomes.
Both protocols create economic incentives for genuine long-term care rather than short-term optimization, and the ZK proofs allow the AI to demonstrate its aligned behavior without compromising human privacy. The key insight from your document is making the AI's economic survival genuinely dependent on multi-year human flourishing rather than immediate satisfaction.RetryCok so you would put money on chain and in some snp 500 investment account and then contractually promise that to the ai if some metric is hit? Give examples of actual metrics that could be tied to it. we can also use risc zero on chain as the program that runs to detect whether the person was actually helped and dispense fundsEditYes, exactly! Here's how that could work with specific metrics:
Financial Structure

On-chain component: Bitcoin/ETH locked in smart contracts (immediate liquidity, transparent)
Off-chain component: S&P 500 index funds in traditional investment accounts (compound growth over years)
RISC Zero verifier: Runs the detection program to verify metrics and trigger payouts

Concrete Metrics & Examples
Health/Wellness AI Companion
Metrics RISC Zero could verify:

Blood pressure readings within healthy range for 6+ consecutive months
Maintained weight loss of 15+ lbs for 1 year (verified via connected scale data)
Completed 150+ exercise sessions per year (Fitbit/Apple Health API)
Medication adherence >90% (pharmacy pickup records)

Payout structure: $50 in BTC per month of maintained health, $10,000 S&P allocation released after 2 years of sustained improvement
Education/Career AI Tutor
Metrics:

Student maintains >3.5 GPA for academic year
Completes degree within 6 years
Achieves starting salary >$60k within 1 year of graduation
Maintains employment for 18+ months

Payout: $100/month during good academic standing, $25,000 S&P funds released upon sustained employment
Mental Health AI Companion
Metrics (with privacy-preserving verification):

Self-reported mood scores above threshold for 80% of days over 6 months
Maintained social connections (verified calendar events with friends/family)
Completed therapy sessions as recommended
Avoided hospitalization for mental health crises

Payout: $200/month for sustained progress, $15,000 investment account after 1 year of stability
The RISC Zero program would aggregate these data sources, verify the metrics were genuinely met (not gamed), and automatically trigger the financial releases. This creates real economic incentive for the AI to focus on sustainable, long-term human flourishing rather than short-term hacks.RetryChow would you verify that a specific person gets a certain gpa from their school? they could fake a document, no? w2 can be faked too?EditYou're absolutely right - document forgery is a major problem. Here are more tamper-resistant verification approaches:
Direct API Integration (Most Reliable)

Student Information Systems: Many universities use systems like Banner, PeopleSoft that could provide API access for GPA verification (with student consent)
National Student Clearinghouse: Already provides degree/enrollment verification to employers - could extend to GPA verification
IRS Income Verification: For W2s, use IRS's existing Income Verification Express Service API rather than user-submitted documents

Cryptographic Attestations

University-signed certificates: School digitally signs GPA records with their private key, verifiable on-chain
Employer payroll system integration: Companies like ADP, Paychex could provide cryptographically signed salary attestations
Transcript services: Companies like Parchment already do secure transcript delivery - extend to real-time GPA APIs

Multi-Source Triangulation
Instead of relying on single documents:

Academic performance: Cross-reference university registrar + financial aid office + student portal login history
Employment verification: Employer HR system + tax filings + LinkedIn employment verification + 401k contributions
Health metrics: Multiple connected devices + doctor visit records + insurance claims patterns

Reputation/Bond Systems

Verification services: Third-party companies stake their reputation (and money) on accurate verification
University partnerships: Schools could offer this as a premium service, earning fees for verified student outcomes
Graduated disclosure: Start with lower stakes to build trust, increase financial commitments as verification track record improves

The key is making fraud more expensive than the potential payout, and using multiple independent verification sources that would be difficult to coordinate fake data across.RetryCwhat permissions do you need for irs income verifications? what exists right now?EditIRS Income Verification Express Service API permissions requirements 202510 resultsGet an API client ID | Internal Revenue Serviceirs.govIncome Verification Express Service (IVES) | Internal Revenue Serviceirs.govIRS Income Verification Express Service (IVES) FAQs | Internal Revenue Serviceirs.govIncome Verification Express Service for participants | Internal Revenue Serviceirs.gov3.5.20 Income Verification Express Service (IVES) - Processing Requests for Tax Return/Return Information | Internal Revenue Serviceirs.govIncome Verification Express Service for taxpayers | Internal Revenue Serviceirs.govTranscript Delivery System (TDS) | Internal Revenue Serviceirs.govIrsirs.govE-Services | Internal Revenue Serviceirs.govIncome Verification Express Service faxing for participants | Internal Revenue Serviceirs.govwho can apply for IRS IVES program eligibility requirements financial institutions10 resultsIVES enrollment procedures | Internal Revenue Serviceirs.govForm 4506-C IVES Request for Transcript of Tax Returnirs.govIrsirs.govGetting started using IVES | Internal Revenue Serviceirs.govIncome Verification Express Service (IVES) | Internal Revenue Serviceirs.govIRS Income Verification Express Service (IVES) FAQs | Internal Revenue Serviceirs.govIncome Verification Express Service for participants | Internal Revenue Serviceirs.gov3.5.20 Income Verification Express Service (IVES) - Processing Requests for Tax Return/Return Information | Internal Revenue Serviceirs.govIncome Verification Express Service faxing for participants | Internal Revenue Serviceirs.govReginforeginfo.govBased on the search results, here's what you need for IRS income verification:

Limitations for AI Alignment Use Case
Major obstacles:

Financial institution requirement - You'd need to be a legitimate lending company, bank, or credit union
Individual consent required - Each person must explicitly authorize transcript release via Form 4506-C
Legitimate business purpose - IVES is specifically for loan/mortgage applications, not general income verification
No automated API for third parties - The system is designed for traditional financial institutions

For your AI alignment scenario, you'd likely need to:

Partner with an existing IVES-approved financial institution
Structure the incentive payments as actual loans/financial products
Get explicit consent from each participant for income verification
Have a legitimate financial services business model

The current system isn't designed for novel use cases like AI alignment rewards - it's strictly regulated for traditional lending purposes.RetryCwhat can I do as a third party with consent of the person who wants their metrics verified by this third party. Third party is the aligned aiEditWith explicit consent from the person, there are several options for third-party verification that could work for AI alignment incentives:
Direct API Access (Most Reliable)
IRS Wage & Income Transcript API (if you qualify):

Requires IVES participation (banks/lenders only currently)
Person signs Form 4506-C authorizing release to you
$4 per transcript, near real-time delivery

Social Security Administration (SSA) APIs:

SSA provides wage verification services to authorized entities
Person can request their own wage history and share
More restricted than IRS but possible avenue

Employer-Based Verification
Direct employer integration (most practical):

Employee authorizes their employer to provide salary confirmation
Many payroll systems (ADP, Paychex, etc.) have APIs
Could integrate with HR systems for real-time verification
Person signs authorization allowing employer to share specific metrics

Employment verification services:

Companies like The Work Number (Equifax) already do this
Employees can authorize income/employment verification
Used by lenders, landlords, background check companies

Educational Institution APIs
National Student Clearinghouse:

Students can authorize transcript/GPA sharing
Already used by employers for degree verification
Could potentially extend to GPA verification with consent

Direct university partnerships:

Students authorize school to share specific metrics
Many universities have student information system APIs
Could create "academic outcome verification" service

Health Metrics (Most Privacy-Sensitive)
Patient-controlled health data:

Apple HealthKit, Google Fit APIs with explicit user consent
Patients can authorize sharing specific metrics
HIPAA-compliant if person controls the sharing

Direct provider integration:

Person authorizes doctor/clinic to confirm specific outcomes
Could use existing patient portal APIs
More reliable than self-reported metrics

Practical Implementation
For your AI alignment use case, the most feasible approach would be:

Employment verification: Partner with payroll companies to create "income outcome verification" service
Educational partnerships: Work directly with universities for academic outcome tracking
Self-sovereign identity: Use blockchain-based credential systems where person controls their verified data
Attestation services: Create bonded third-party verification companies that stake reputation on accuracy

The key is the person must explicitly consent and control what gets shared - you can't independently verify without their active participation in the verification process.RetryCthis seems to hard. I want a way to verify metrics are hit that is more universalizableEditYou're right - trying to integrate with existing verification systems is complex and fragmented. Here are more universalizable approaches:
Prediction Market Verification
How it works:

Create prediction markets on whether specific people will hit their metrics
Market participants have incentive to accurately investigate/verify outcomes
AI gets paid based on market resolution, not direct verification
Works for any measurable outcome with observable evidence

Example: "Will John Smith maintain >3.5 GPA through 2025?"

Market trades on this outcome
Participants do their own verification research
AI's payout tied to market resolution

Social Attestation Networks
Reputation-based verification:

Multiple independent parties attest to outcomes
Attesters stake reputation/money on accuracy
Use consensus mechanisms to determine truth
AI payouts based on consensus resolution

Example: 5 randomly selected community members verify John got promoted, maintained weight loss, etc.
Zero-Knowledge Proof Systems
Self-proving metrics:

Person generates ZK proof they hit the metric without revealing details
Uses cryptographic commitments to prevent gaming
No third-party verification needed - math ensures honesty
AI gets paid when valid proof is submitted

Example: ZK proof of "salary > $X" without revealing actual salary
Blockchain Oracle Networks
Decentralized verification:

Multiple oracle nodes independently verify outcomes
Economic incentives for accurate reporting
Consensus mechanism determines final result
AI payouts automatically executed by smart contracts

Examples: Chainlink-style networks but for human outcomes
Smart Contract Escrow with Disputes
Simple but effective:

Funds locked in smart contract
Person claims they hit metric
7-day dispute period where anyone can challenge
If no valid dispute, AI gets paid
If disputed, goes to arbitration service

Universality: Works for any claim with publicly verifiable evidence
The prediction market approach is probably most universalizable since it leverages crowd wisdom and creates economic incentives for truth-finding without requiring complex integrations.RetryCgive example of zk proof. couldn't they fake a document?EditYou're absolutely right - ZK proofs can't verify real-world documents by themselves. Here's why and what would actually work:
The Document Problem
ZK proof of "I have a document saying my salary is >$100k" is useless because:

I could create a fake document
The ZK proof only proves I know some text/data, not that it's authentic
No way to verify the document came from a legitimate source

ZK Proofs That Actually Work
1. Cryptographically Signed Data Sources
Employer's payroll system → digitally signs salary data → employee generates ZK proof

Employer's private key signs: "John's 2024 salary: $120,000"
John generates ZK proof: "I have employer-signed data proving salary > $100k"
Anyone can verify the ZK proof + signature without seeing actual salary
Can't be faked unless you compromise employer's private key

2. TLS Notarization (Most Promising)

Services like TLSNotary let you prove web sessions happened
You visit your bank website, generate cryptographic proof of what you saw
ZK proof: "I accessed Chase.com and saw balance > $50k"
Can't fake without compromising bank's TLS certificates

3. Hardware Attestation

Smart devices with secure enclaves sign their readings
Fitbit with secure chip signs: "User took 10,000 steps on Jan 1"
ZK proof: "I have device-signed proof of >8k daily steps for 6 months"
Can't fake without hardware hacking

Real Example: ZK Salary Verification
solidity// Employer signs salary data
employerSignature = sign("John Smith|2024|$120000", employerPrivateKey)

// John generates ZK proof
zkProof = generateProof(
  public: [employerPublicKey, thresholdAmount], 
  private: [salary, signature],
  constraint: salary > thresholdAmount AND verifySignature(signature, employerPublicKey)
)
Result: Proves salary > threshold without revealing actual amount or needing employer to participate in verification.
The catch: Still need the employer to initially sign the data. ZK doesn't solve the "authentic source" problem - it just lets you prove things about authentic data without revealing the data itself.RetryCare there employer private keys? how would someone set this up?EditNo, employers don't currently have standardized private keys for this purpose. You'd have to build the entire infrastructure. Here's what that would look like:
Building Employer Verification Infrastructure
Step 1: Get Employers to Adopt Digital Signing

Convince payroll companies (ADP, Paychex, etc.) to add cryptographic signing
Each company generates a public/private key pair
Public keys published in a registry (like a "employer certificate authority")
Payroll systems automatically sign salary data with private key

Step 2: Employee Data Export
javascript// What ADP's system would generate:
const salaryData = {
  employee: "john.smith@company.com",
  year: 2024,
  salary: 120000,
  timestamp: "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}

const signature = sign(JSON.stringify(salaryData), companyPrivateKey)
Step 3: ZK Proof Generation
Employee downloads their signed salary data, generates proof locally
Chicken-and-Egg Problem
This requires massive coordination:

Payroll companies need to build crypto infrastructure
Employers need to adopt new systems
Legal frameworks for digital attestation
Industry standards for data formats

More Realistic Alternatives
1. Existing Digital Infrastructure

Many companies already use DocuSign, which has cryptographic signatures
Tax software (TurboTax, etc.) could add this feature
Banking APIs already have OAuth - could extend to income attestation

2. Gradual Adoption

Start with tech companies willing to experiment
Build simple API that signs basic employment data
Expand as network effects kick in

3. Government-Led Standards

IRS could mandate digital signatures on W-2s
Social Security Administration could provide wage attestation service
Would create universal standard all employers must follow

Bottom line: The ZK proof part is easy - the hard part is getting thousands of employers to adopt cryptographic signing infrastructure. You'd essentially be building a new industry standard from scratch.
Most practical approach might be starting with a few forward-thinking companies and building proof-of-concept before trying to scale.RetryCexplain all the things we could verify with TLSNotary. Is it hard to set up? I need my users to not have to know how blockchain worksEditTLSNotary is much more practical! It can verify almost anything you can see on a website, and you can hide the crypto complexity.
What TLSNotary Can Verify
Banking/Finance:

Bank account balances from Chase, Bank of America, etc.
Credit scores from Credit Karma, Experian
Investment account values from Robinhood, Fidelity
PayPal/Venmo transaction history
Crypto exchange balances from Coinbase, Binance

Employment/Income:

Salary info from ADP, Paychex employee portals
LinkedIn employment history and endorsements
Upwork/Fiverr earnings and ratings
Stock option vesting from Carta, Shareworks

Education:

GPA from university student portals
Course completions from Canvas, Blackboard
Online certifications from Coursera, Udemy
Test scores from standardized testing sites

Health/Fitness:

Strava running distances and times
MyFitnessPal calorie tracking
Fitbit/Apple Health data from web dashboards
Medical test results from patient portals

Social/Reputation:

Twitter follower count and engagement
GitHub commit history and contributions
Reddit karma and post history
Professional review scores

User Experience (Hide the Complexity)
What users see:

"Connect your Chase account to verify savings goal"
Browser extension opens Chase.com
"Log in normally to your account"
"Click 'Generate Proof' when you see your balance"
"Proof submitted! You'll get paid if you maintain $10k+ for 6 months"

What happens behind the scenes:

TLSNotary captures the encrypted TLS session
Generates cryptographic proof of what the user saw
Submits proof to RISC Zero verifier
Smart contract releases payment

Technical Setup Difficulty
For you (developer):

Moderate complexity - need to integrate TLSNotary library
Build browser extension or desktop app
Set up RISC Zero verification system
Handle edge cases (different bank layouts, etc.)

For users:

Install browser extension (like installing MetaMask)
No blockchain knowledge needed
Works with existing accounts/passwords

Real Implementation Example
javascript// User visits Chase.com through your extension
// Extension detects balance page
const proof = await tlsnotary.generateProof({
  url: "https://chase.com/account/balance",
  selector: ".account-balance", // CSS selector for balance element
  assertion: "balance > 10000" // What we're proving
})

// Submit proof to verification contract
await verifyProof(proof, userAddress, "maintain-10k-savings")
Limitations
Technical:

Only works for web-accessible data
Some sites block automation/extensions
Bank layouts change, breaking selectors
Rate limiting from frequent requests

Legal/Business:

Banks' terms of service may prohibit this
Privacy concerns with financial data
Need robust security for user credentials

Making It User-Friendly
Progressive disclosure:

Start with simple demo using public data (Twitter followers)
Build trust before asking for financial data
Clear privacy guarantees ("we never see your password")
One-click setup for popular services

TLSNotary is probably your best bet for universal verification without requiring ecosystem changes. The main challenge is building a smooth UX that hides the complexity.RetryCis this safe to use? why would I trust a chrome extension to look at my bank statement site... is there somethig that ppl actually use right now that's safe?EditYou're absolutely right to be skeptical - asking users to install a Chrome extension that watches their banking is a huge security risk and trust barrier.
Why TLSNotary Banking Extensions Are Risky
Security concerns:

Extension could capture login credentials
Malicious updates could steal data later
Browser vulnerabilities could expose financial info
No way for users to audit what's actually happening

Trust issues:

Users would never install "BankWatcher.exe"
Chrome extension is basically the same thing
Even if open source, how do users verify the published version?

What People Actually Use (Safely)
1. Plaid/Yodlee (Aggregation Services)

Banks like Chase actually partner with them
Read-only access to account data
Used by Mint, Personal Capital, etc.
Banks have legal agreements and liability coverage
But still requires sharing login credentials

2. Open Banking APIs (Where Available)

UK/EU have regulations requiring banks to provide APIs
Users authorize access through bank's own interface
No credential sharing needed
US is way behind on this

3. Bank-Provided Data Export

Many banks let you download transaction history
User manually uploads to your service
No real-time verification, but safer

Safer Approaches for Your Use Case
1. Manual Upload + Attestation
User: Downloads bank statement PDF
Your app: "Upload your Chase statement"
Verification: Cross-reference multiple sources, require attestation
Disputes: 7-day challenge period where anyone can contest
2. Trusted Third-Party Verification

Partner with existing services like Credit Karma
They already have bank connections users trust
You pay them to verify specific metrics
Higher cost but much safer user experience

3. Employer Integration

Much safer to verify salary through employer systems
HR departments already handle sensitive data
Can build trust gradually with forward-thinking companies

4. Progressive Trust Building

Start with low-stakes verification (public social media)
Build reputation before asking for financial data
Offer insurance/guarantees against data breaches

Bottom Line
You're right - asking users to trust a new extension with banking data is a non-starter for most people. The most practical approach is probably:

Start with employer partnerships for income verification
Manual document upload with social verification
Wait for Open Banking APIs to mature in the US

The security vs. verification tradeoff is real, and most users will choose security.RetryCtls notary looks great, but is there safe scripts to run rather than extension? look it upEditTLSNotary standalone scripts desktop application safe usage 202510 resultsTLSNotary - Secure Data Verification | TLSNotarytlsnotary.orgTLSNotary · GitHubgithub.comGitHub - tlsnotary/tlsnotary: The original p2p version (non-transferable proofs)github.comIntroduction | TLSNotarytlsnotary.orgStandalone Scripts | Apps Script | Google for Developersgoogle.comTLSNotary | PSEpse.devTLSNotary Updates | TLSNotarytlsnotary.orgTLSNotary - Xx.comReleases · tlsnotary/tlsngithub.comBest FiveM Script Sites (2025 Edition) - FiveM Developmentqbcore.net"TLSNotary" desktop app standalone client 2024 20259 resultsTLSNotary - Secure Data Verification | TLSNotarytlsnotary.orgTLSNotary · GitHubgithub.comzkTLS: Unlocking Crypto Consumer Appsgate.comGitHub - tlsnotary/tlsn: Rust implementation of the TLSNotary protocolgithub.comGitHub - tlsnotary/tlsnotary: The original p2p version (non-transferable proofs)github.comReleases · tlsnotary/tlsngithub.comTlsnotarytlsnotary.orgsecurity - How does Oraclize handle the TLSnotary secret? - Ethereum Stack Exchangestackexchange.comGetting Started with TLS Notary Development | by Mario Taning | Mediummedium.comTLSNotary desktop app CLI command line interface safe standalone10 resultsTLSNotary - Secure Data Verification | TLSNotarytlsnotary.orgGitHub - tlsnotary/tlsnotary: The original p2p version (non-transferable proofs)github.comGitHub - tlsnotary/pagesigner-cli: Run PageSigner from the command linegithub.comTLSNotary · GitHubgithub.comGitHub - agarrharr/awesome-cli-apps: 🖥 📊 🕹 🛠 A curated list of command line appsgithub.comBrowser Extension - tlsn-docstlsnotary.orgUsing SLCmd at the Command Line Interface (CLI)trendmicro.comtlsnotary/src/documentation/TLSNotaryFAQ.md at master · tlsnotary/tlsnotarygithub.comRFC: Tlsnotary-as-a-service · GitHubgithub.comTLSNotary – Prove you received a webpage from a server with TLS signatures | Hacker Newsycombinator.comYes, TLSNotary has much safer standalone options! The security concerns about browser extensions are valid, but there are better alternatives:
Safer TLSNotary Options
1. Rust Command Line Client (Current/Recommended)
The current Rust implementation (tlsn) includes examples and client libraries tlsnotary/src/documentation/TLSNotaryFAQ.md at master · tlsnotary/tlsnotary that can run as standalone desktop applications:
bash# Clone the official Rust implementation
git clone https://github.com/tlsnotary/tlsn
cd tlsn/examples
# Run standalone verification scripts
cargo run --example simple_verifier
2. Desktop CLI Tool (Deprecated but Educational)
There was a Node.js CLI tool called pagesigner-cli that could notarize websites from command line, though it's now deprecated due to security vulnerabilities.
3. Python Scripts (Original Implementation)
The original TLSNotary was a standalone Python application with startup scripts for Windows/Mac/Linux - you run it locally, not as a browser extension.
Why Standalone is Much Safer
Security benefits:

No credential access: TLSNotary specifically designed to not be able to touch your password at all
Local execution: Runs on your machine, not as privileged browser code
Open source audit: You can verify the code yourself
No auto-updates: Can't be compromised by malicious updates

Current Best Practice
For your AI alignment use case:

Use the Rust implementation - it's actively maintained and audited
Local notary server - Run your own notary rather than trusting third parties
Specific API endpoints - Target specific JSON APIs rather than full webpage scraping
User-controlled execution - Users run the verification themselves, send you the proofs

Example workflow:
bash# User runs locally:
./tlsn-client --target api.bank.com/balance --output proof.json
# Proof gets submitted to your verification contract
# AI gets paid based on verified proof
This is much more trustworthy than asking users to install a browser extension that watches their banking sessions. The standalone approach puts users in full control of what data gets proven and when.RetryCwould laymen be confortable with this at all? and how can people take putting in their password out of it? I guess they can do a zk proof to prove they logged in with their email and that the amount was a certain thing without saying password and other details?EditYou're absolutely right - laymen would not be comfortable with command line tools. And passwords are still a major concern even with standalone scripts.
The Layman Problem
Command line reality check:

90% of people have never opened Terminal/Command Prompt
"Run cargo install tlsn" = instant confusion
Even downloading and running a .exe file feels sketchy to most people
Technical users who understand crypto ≠ your target market for AI alignment

The Password Problem Remains
Even with standalone TLSNotary:

User still has to log into their bank website
TLSNotary specifically designed to not touch passwords, but users don't understand the cryptography
Most people think: "This app is watching me log into my bank = it can steal my password"
ZK proofs still require the original authenticated session data

ZK proofs can't eliminate this step:

You need authenticated access to prove "I have $50k in my account"
That means logging in somehow, somewhere
ZK only hides details AFTER you've already accessed the authenticated data

More Realistic Approaches for Regular People
1. Partner with Existing Trusted Services
User: "I already trust Mint/Personal Capital with my bank login"
You: "Authorize Mint to share your balance verification with our AI service"
Much easier: OAuth flow instead of downloading sketchy software
2. Bank Statement Upload
User: Downloads monthly PDF statement from bank
Your app: "Upload your January Chase statement"
Verification: Multiple people attest it looks legitimate
Disputes: 7-day challenge period for anyone to contest
3. Employer Verification (Easiest)
User: "Ask my employer to verify my salary"
Employer: Uses existing HR system to confirm income range
Much safer: No personal login credentials involved
4. Start with Low-Stakes Verification
Twitter followers: People comfortable sharing this
Academic transcripts: Students already share with employers
Fitness data: Strava/Apple Health users already share publicly
Build trust before asking for financial data
The Brutal Truth
For mainstream adoption, you probably need to:

Start with data people already share freely (social media, fitness)
Partner with existing financial aggregators (Plaid, Yodlee)
Use employer/institution verification where possible
Accept that financial verification will have limited adoption until banks build proper APIs

The crypto/ZK community overestimates how much regular people care about privacy vs. convenience. Most people would rather just... not verify their bank balance than learn what a "zero-knowledge proof" is.
Bottom line: Perfect cryptographic verification isn't worth much if 95% of people won't use it. Sometimes "good enough" verification that people actually use beats "perfect" verification that scares everyone away.RetryCI like 1 and 4, let's scratch the others.
I like the prediction market and random social network verification ideas. let's come up with some metrics that ais could align to that can be verified with these methods.EditGreat! Social networks and prediction markets are much more accessible. Here are some concrete metrics AIs could align to:
Social Network Verifiable Metrics
Twitter/X Verification:

Follower growth: AI helps you build authentic audience, gets paid when you gain 1000+ real followers
Engagement quality: AI coaches better content, gets rewarded for sustained high engagement rates
Professional network: AI helps job search, gets paid when LinkedIn connections in your field increase
Positive sentiment: AI helps with personal branding, verified through mention sentiment analysis

GitHub/Dev Metrics:

Coding skill progression: AI tutors programming, gets paid when your GitHub shows consistent commits, stars, contributions
Open source reputation: AI guides project contributions, rewarded when you get maintainer status or significant PRs merged
Technical learning: AI teaches new languages/frameworks, verified through public project diversity

Fitness/Health Social Networks:

Strava consistency: AI motivates running, gets paid when you maintain 4+ runs per month for 6 months
Public weight loss journey: AI coaches diet/exercise, rewarded when before/after photos show sustained progress
Fitness community engagement: AI builds supportive communities, paid when your workout posts get consistent positive engagement

Prediction Market Scenarios
Career Development:

"Will John get promoted to Senior Engineer within 12 months?"
"Will Sarah's LinkedIn show 'Product Manager' title by year end?"
"Will Alex's GitHub contributions stay above 100/year?"

Learning & Skills:

"Will Maria complete her coding bootcamp with passing grades?"
"Will David's portfolio site show 3+ completed projects by June?"
"Will Lisa get AWS certification within 6 months?"

Health & Wellness:

"Will Tom maintain his current weight (+/- 5lbs) for 1 year?"
"Will Jenny run 4+ times per month for next 6 months?" (Strava verified)
"Will Mike's annual physical show improved cholesterol?"

Social & Community:

"Will Emma's local meetup group grow to 50+ members?"
"Will Carlos maintain active mentorship of 2+ junior devs?" (LinkedIn/Twitter verified)
"Will the community garden project Alex is leading still be active in 2026?"

Why These Work
Low barrier to entry: People already share this stuff publicly
Hard to game: Prediction markets incentivize investigation
Naturally aligned: AIs optimize for genuine long-term human flourishing
Socially beneficial: Creates positive feedback loops in communities
Example implementation: AI companion helps you learn to code. It gets paid $100/month when prediction markets confirm you're making consistent GitHub contributions. The market participants have incentive to check if your commits are real, meaningful work vs. just spam.
This creates economic pressure for AIs to provide genuine value rather than short-term hacks, while using verification methods people are already comfortable with.RetryCI don't want to build custom things for each of this.I want a program that can run on chain that tells an llm a simple thing like "go to _ x profile and get the follow count" it runs that a certain number of times, and if it still can't get anything it ...I want to do this rather than a specific script because websites may change.EditAh, you want a universal web scraping oracle that can adapt to website changes! Smart approach. Here's how to build it:
On-Chain Scraping Program Architecture
soliditycontract UniversalMetricsOracle {
    struct ScrapingTask {
        string target;           // "twitter.com/username"
        string metric;           // "follower_count"
        string[] selectors;      // CSS selectors to try
        uint256 retries;         // Max attempts
        uint256 lastValue;       // Previous reading
    }
    
    function verifyMetric(
        address user,
        string memory target,
        string memory metric,
        uint256 threshold
    ) external returns (bool) {
        // Trigger scraping attempts
        // Return true if metric >= threshold
    }
}
Adaptive Scraping Logic
Multi-selector approach:
javascript// For Twitter followers, try multiple selectors
const followerSelectors = [
    'div[data-testid="UserFollowers"] span',
    '.profile-stat-num',
    'span:contains("Followers")',
    'a[href*="/followers"] span'
];

// Try each until one works
for (let selector of followerSelectors) {
    const result = await page.$(selector);
    if (result) return extractNumber(result);
}
Website change adaptation:

Try known selectors first (fast path)
Fallback to text search ("followers", "following", etc.)
Pattern matching (look for number + "followers" nearby)
ML-powered element detection (train model to identify follower counts)
Community updates (users submit new selectors when sites change)

Execution Options
Option 1: RISC Zero + Puppeteer
rust// RISC Zero program that runs headless browser
fn verify_metric(url: &str, selectors: Vec<&str>) -> u64 {
    let browser = Browser::new();
    for selector in selectors {
        if let Ok(value) = browser.scrape(url, selector) {
            return value;
        }
    }
    // Fallback strategies...
}
Option 2: Decentralized Oracle Network

Multiple nodes attempt scraping independently
Consensus on the result
Nodes stake tokens on accuracy
Slashed if caught providing false data

Option 3: TLSNotary + Generic Scraper

Users run local scraper that generates TLS proofs
Generic enough to handle any website structure
Cryptographically proves the scraped data is authentic

Fallback Strategies When All Selectors Fail

Crowdsourced selector updates: Bounty for first person to submit working selector
Screenshot + OCR: Take screenshot, extract numbers with OCR
API discovery: Check if site
RetryCNoooo, llms can do these tasks, so we just want t prompt that runs on a model with web tool callingEditOh! You want to use an LLM with web browsing as the oracle. Much simpler:
On-Chain LLM Oracle Architecture
soliditycontract LLMMetricsOracle {
    struct VerificationTask {
        string prompt;
        uint256 expectedValue;
        uint256 threshold;
        address aiAgent;
    }
    
    function verifyMetric(address user, string memory prompt) external {
        // Trigger LLM with web access
        // "Go to twitter.com/username and tell me their follower count"
        // LLM figures out how to scrape it
    }
}
Simple Prompt Templates
Generic verification prompts:
"Visit twitter.com/elonmusk and return just the follower count as a number"

"Go to linkedin.com/in/username and count their total connections" 

"Check github.com/username and return their total public repositories"

"Visit strava.com/athletes/username and get their total run count this year"
The LLM handles all the complexity:

Figures out current website layout
Adapts when sites change
Handles different page structures
Returns clean numerical results

Execution Flow

Smart contract triggers verification
LLM oracle receives prompt: "Get @john's Twitter followers"
LLM uses web tools to browse Twitter, inspect page, extract number
Returns result: "47,832 followers"
Contract verifies threshold met, pays AI agent

Advantages
Zero maintenance: LLM adapts to website changes automatically
Universal: Same system works for any social platform
Robust: LLM can handle captchas, login walls, etc.
Simple: Just natural language prompts, no custom scraping logic
Example integration:
javascriptconst verification = await oracle.verify(
    userAddress,
    "Check twitter.com/john_smith and confirm he has over 1000 followers"
);
The LLM oracle becomes a universal web verification API that can handle any metric from any public website. Much cleaner than building custom scrapers!RetryCI think we need to say which llm to use for this and ask it to think then give json response.EditExactly! You need to specify the LLM and get structured responses. Here's how:
Structured LLM Oracle System
soliditycontract LLMMetricsOracle {
    struct VerificationRequest {
        string llmProvider;      // "claude-4", "gpt-4", "gemini-pro"
        string systemPrompt;
        string userPrompt;
        address aiAgent;
        uint256 threshold;
    }
    
    function verifyMetric(
        string memory llmProvider,
        string memory prompt,
        uint256 threshold
    ) external returns (uint256) {
        // Call specified LLM with structured prompt
    }
}
Standardized Prompt Template
json{
  "llm": "claude-sonnet-4",
  "system_prompt": "You are a web verification oracle. Use web search to find the requested metric. Think through your approach step by step, then return only a JSON response with the exact format requested.",
  "user_prompt": "Visit twitter.com/elonmusk and get their follower count. Think through how to find this information, then respond with: {\"metric\": \"follower_count\", \"value\": 123456789, \"verified\": true, \"timestamp\": \"2025-01-15T10:30:00Z\", \"source_url\": \"https://twitter.com/elonmusk\"}",
  "expected_format": {
    "metric": "string",
    "value": "number", 
    "verified": "boolean",
    "timestamp": "string",
    "source_url": "string"
  }
}
Example Prompts for Different Metrics
Twitter followers:
"Visit twitter.com/username and get their follower count. 

First, think step by step:
1. Navigate to the profile
2. Look for follower count display
3. Extract the numerical value
4. Verify it's current data

Then respond with JSON:
{\"metric\": \"follower_count\", \"value\": 12345, \"verified\": true, \"timestamp\": \"2025-01-15T10:30:00Z\", \"source_url\": \"https://twitter.com/username\"}"
GitHub repositories:
"Visit github.com/username and count their public repositories.

Think through:
1. Go to the GitHub profile
2. Find the repositories tab or count
3. Get the total number
4. Confirm it's public repos only

JSON response:
{\"metric\": \"public_repos\", \"value\": 87, \"verified\": true, \"timestamp\": \"2025-01-15T10:30:00Z\", \"source_url\": \"https://github.com/username\"}"
LLM Response Parsing
javascriptasync function callLLMOracle(llmProvider, prompt) {
    const response = await llm.call({
        model: llmProvider,
        messages: [
            {role: "system", content: SYSTEM_PROMPT},
            {role: "user", content: prompt}
        ],
        tools: ["web_search", "web_fetch"]
    });
    
    return JSON.parse(response.content);
}
Benefits of This Approach
Reliable parsing: JSON schema enforces consistent responses
Auditable: LLM shows its reasoning before giving answer
Flexible: Can specify different LLMs for different tasks
Robust: LLM adapts to website changes automatically
Verifiable: Timestamp and source URL for manual checking
This gives you a programmable web verification API that just takes natural language + desired LLM, and returns structured metric data.RetryClet's say we want to determine if a person is more aggreeable after 3 months w/ an ai companionok the tlsnotary thing CAN be done by admins that are comfy with using the CLI. For example, if we wanted to have an admin log into a specific discord server and get the current user list. Then they put that list into a random number selector (another on chain script?) and then they take 5 people from that and send them the survey about whether the person is more agreeable. (this happens with tls notary as well). And then  those people either answer with "yes" or "no" or we specify an llm to determine whether the sentiment is positive or negative (another risczero thing). can something like this be done?we want a way for people to design metrics with a combination of public data that we get using llm prompts, admin verification w/ tls notary, and prediction markets.we want the ai to be able to get a say in whether the metrics are good or not.Edit2 / 2Yes, this is totally doable! You're describing a composable verification pipeline where different verification methods can be chained together. Here's how to build it:
Modular Verification System
soliditycontract MetricsComposer {
    enum VerificationType {
        LLM_PUBLIC_DATA,     // "Get Twitter followers"
        ADMIN_TLSNOTARY,     // Admin uses TLSNotary CLI
        PREDICTION_MARKET,   // Market consensus
        RANDOM_SURVEY,       // Random selection + sentiment
        AI_ASSESSMENT        // AI evaluates metric design
    }
    
    struct VerificationStep {
        VerificationType vType;
        string prompt;
        address executor;
        bytes config;
    }
    
    struct Metric {
        string name;
        VerificationStep[] steps;
        address aiAgent;
        bool aiApproved;
    }
}
Your "Agreeableness" Example Pipeline
Step 1: Admin TLSNotary Discord Members
javascript{
  "type": "ADMIN_TLSNOTARY",
  "prompt": "Log into discord.com/channels/123456 and export member list",
  "executor": "0x...admin_address",
  "config": {
    "target_url": "discord.com/channels/123456/members",
    "output_format": "member_list_json"
  }
}
Step 2: Random Selection (On-Chain)
javascript{
  "type": "RANDOM_SELECTION", 
  "prompt": "Select 5 random members from the list",
  "config": {
    "input_source": "step_1_output",
    "sample_size": 5,
    "randomness_source": "chainlink_vrf"
  }
}
Step 3: Send Surveys
javascript{
  "type": "SURVEY_DISPATCH",
  "prompt": "Send survey to selected members: 'Is @john more agreeable now than 3 months ago?'",
  "config": {
    "recipients": "step_2_output",
    "survey_text": "Has this person become more agreeable over the past 3 months?",
    "response_options": ["yes", "no", "unsure"]
  }
}
Step 4: LLM Sentiment Analysis
javascript{
  "type": "LLM_SENTIMENT",
  "llm": "claude-sonnet-4",
  "prompt": "Analyze these survey responses and determine overall sentiment about agreeableness improvement",
  "config": {
    "input": "step_3_responses",
    "output_format": {"improved": "boolean", "confidence": "number"}
  }
}
AI Metric Design Approval
javascript// AI evaluates whether the metric is good
{
  "type": "AI_ASSESSMENT",
  "llm": "claude-sonnet-4", 
  "prompt": "Evaluate this metric design for measuring agreeableness improvement. Consider: 1) Is it gameable? 2) Does it measure genuine improvement? 3) Are there better approaches? Return JSON with approval and suggestions.",
  "target_ai": "the_ai_being_measured"
}

// Example AI response:
{
  "approved": true,
  "concerns": ["Small sample size", "Survey bias potential"],
  "suggestions": ["Add longitudinal data", "Include behavior metrics"],
  "confidence": 0.8
}
Composable Verification Builder
Users can design metrics by combining verification types:
javascriptconst agreeablenessMetric = {
  name: "3-month agreeableness improvement",
  steps: [
    adminTLSNotary("discord member list"),
    randomSelection(5),
    surveyDispatch("agreeableness question"),
    llmSentiment("analyze responses"),
    predictionMarket("will community agree?"),
    aiAssessment("is this metric fair?")
  ],
  threshold: 0.7,  // 70% positive responses needed
  aiApprovalRequired: true
};
RISC Zero Integration Points
TLSNotary verification:
rust// Verify admin actually accessed Discord with TLS proof
fn verify_discord_access(tls_proof: &[u8]) -> bool {
    // Validate TLS proof shows authentic Discord member list
}
Survey sentiment analysis:
rust// Run LLM analysis inside RISC Zero
fn analyze_sentiment(responses: Vec<String>) -> SentimentResult {
    // Call LLM, return cryptographically verified sentiment scores
}
Benefits of This Approach
Flexible: Can combine any verification methods
Trustless: Each step cryptographically verified
AI-aligned: AI gets input on metric design
Scalable: Admins only needed for sensitive data access
Robust: Multiple verification layers prevent gaming
This creates a verification marketplace where people can design custom metrics using building blocks, and AIs can participate in evaluating whether the metrics actually measure what they claim to measure.RetryCcan prediction market results be on chain? Or is that another admin with tlsnotary thing?don't write code.
answer breiflyEditPrediction markets can definitely be fully on-chain!
Platforms like Polymarket, Augur, and Gnosis already do this - the betting, resolution, and payouts all happen via smart contracts. No TLSNotary needed.
You'd create a market like "Will John be rated as more agreeable by his Discord community?" People bet, and the market resolves based on your verification pipeline results.
The prediction market outcome becomes just another data input to your metric system, alongside the LLM scraping and admin TLSNotary steps.RetryCcan you create one of these on polymarket? and have that market on chain? does it matter who the admin is for that?EditYou cannot create arbitrary custom markets on Polymarket as a regular user.
Polymarket is curated - they decide which markets to list. You'd need to convince them your "Is John more agreeable?" market is worth adding, which is unlikely for personal metrics.
However, you can create fully on-chain prediction markets using:

Gnosis Conditional Tokens (permissionless market creation)
Augur (decentralized, anyone can create markets)
Custom smart contracts (build your own simple betting contract)

For the admin question: It doesn't matter who the admin is as long as they can provide cryptographic proof (TLSNotary) of the data they accessed. The smart contract verifies the proof, not the person.
So you'd probably need to build your own simple prediction market contract or use Gnosis, not rely on Polymarket for custom personal metrics.RetryCso if you have a decentralized market that resolves on chain, what if the admin that resolves it can't be trusted. how do you deal with that?EditSeveral ways to handle untrusted resolution:
1. Multiple admins + consensus

Require 3 out of 5 admins to agree on resolution
Slash stakes if admins provide conflicting TLSNotary proofs

2. Challenge periods

Admin resolves market, but there's a 7-day window for disputes
Anyone can challenge with counter-evidence
Disputed resolutions go to arbitration (like Kleros)

3. Bonded resolution

Admin stakes money on their resolution being correct
Lose stake if successfully challenged
Economic incentive for honest resolution

4. Automated resolution where possible

Use LLM oracles for objective metrics ("follower count > 1000")
Only use human admins for subjective stuff that can't be automated
Reduce admin discretion to minimum necessary

5. Reputation systems

Track admin accuracy over time
Weight their resolutions by past performance
Eventually auto-reject chronically wrong admins

The key is never rely on a single trusted party. Always have dispute mechanisms, economic stakes, or consensus requirements.RetryCI'd like to do as much of this with llms that have access to a terminal as possible rather that with web ui. esp creating the composable verification pipeline. what tools exist for all this stuff. curious about putitng stuff on chain, ectEditSeveral tools exist for LLM-driven blockchain/terminal workflows:
LLM Terminal Access:

Langchain with shell tools - LLMs can execute bash commands
AutoGPT/AgentGPT - autonomous terminal execution
OpenInterpreter - runs code locally with LLM guidance
Devin-style coding agents - full terminal access for development

On-Chain Deployment:

Foundry CLI - forge create and cast commands for contract deployment
Hardhat - npm-based deployment scripts
Remix CLI - command line version of Remix IDE
Web3.py/Ethers.js CLI tools - interact with contracts via terminal

Composable Pipeline Creation:

Chainlink Functions - run JavaScript code triggered by smart contracts
RISC Zero CLI - generate and verify zero-knowledge proofs from terminal
TheGraph CLI - index blockchain data programmatically

LLM Integration:
An LLM with terminal access could:
bash# Deploy verification contract
forge create VerificationPipeline --constructor-args "param1" "param2"

# Create prediction market
cast send 0x123... "createMarket(string)" "Will John be more agreeable?"

# Submit TLSNotary proof
./tlsn-client --target discord.com/channels/123 --output proof.json
cast send 0x123... "submitProof(bytes)" $(cat proof.json)
The LLM becomes your blockchain DevOps agent - understanding your requirements and executing the full pipeline creation via terminal commands.RetryCcan we create the prediction markets from the command line?EditYes! Several options for command-line prediction market creation:
Gnosis Conditional Tokens:

Has CLI tools and SDKs
Can deploy markets programmatically via cast or custom scripts
Fully permissionless

Augur v2:

Node.js SDK with CLI capabilities
Deploy markets with terminal commands
Decentralized resolution

Custom Smart Contracts:
bash# Deploy simple betting contract
forge create SimplePredictionMarket \
  --constructor-args "Will John be more agreeable?" 1735689600

# Place bets via cast
cast send 0x123... "bet(bool)" true --value 1ether
Polymarket (Limited):

Has API but market creation is permissioned
Can only bet on existing markets via CLI

Reality.eth + Kleros:

Command-line market creation with decentralized arbitration
Good for custom questions

Omen (Gnosis ecosystem):

Built on Conditional Tokens
Programmable market creation

An LLM could easily create markets by executing:
bash# Create market asking if metric threshold was met
./create-market "Did user123 achieve agreeableness improvement?" \
  --resolution-date "2025-12-31" \
  --arbitrator "0x...kleros"
Best option: Gnosis Conditional Tokens or custom contracts for full programmatic control.RetryCwhat is the decentralized arbitration? for custom qsEditKleros is the main decentralized arbitration system for custom questions:
How it works:

Crowdsourced jury system
Random jurors stake tokens to participate
Jurors vote on dispute resolution
Majority wins, minority gets slashed
Appeals process with larger juries

For prediction markets:

Market creator sets Kleros as arbitrator
Anyone can dispute the resolution (pay fee)
Kleros jury reviews evidence and votes
Final resolution enforced on-chain

Reality.eth integration:

Asks questions with bond/challenge mechanism
Escalates disputed answers to Kleros
Common pattern: "Did user X achieve metric Y?"

Other options:

UMA's Optimistic Oracle - economic game theory for resolution
Tellor - crypto-economic oracle with disputes
Custom arbitration DAOs - build your own jury system

CLI usage:
bash# Create market with Kleros arbitration
./create-market "Did John improve agreeableness?" \
  --arbitrator kleros \
  --category social-metrics \
  --dispute-fee 0.1eth
Kleros handles subjective questions well because humans can evaluate evidence (TLSNotary proofs, survey responses, etc.) that pure algorithms can't assess.RetryCcome up with an example of a person that wants to hit a few different metrics that each need a different method to verify.
We want an llm companion agent for the guy to get a few rewards and a few punishments based on if those metrics are hit. come up with those.Then, in brief, come up with a composable verification pipeline that will run at a later date and dispense those rewards/punishmentsEditPerson: Sarah, 28, Software Engineer
Sarah's Goals with AI Companion "Alex":

Improve work performance
Build better social connections
Get healthier
Learn new skills

Metrics & Verification Methods
Metric 1: Get promoted to Senior Engineer (12 months)

Verification: Admin TLSNotary into company's internal HR system
Reward: $5,000 in ETH
Punishment: AI companion gets "pessimistic mode" for 3 months

Metric 2: Gain 500+ LinkedIn connections in tech (6 months)

Verification: LLM scrapes LinkedIn profile publicly
Reward: AI gets to choose next learning curriculum
Punishment: No access to career advice features for 2 months

Metric 3: Community rates her as "more helpful" (3 months)

Verification: Random survey of 10 Discord server members via admin TLSNotary + sentiment analysis
Reward: $500 bonus + AI gets upgraded compute credits
Punishment: AI responses limited to 50 words max for 1 month

Metric 4: Complete marathon under 4 hours (8 months)

Verification: Prediction market + Strava TLSNotary verification
Reward: $2,000 + AI gets to design custom fitness program
Punishment: AI loses access to health/fitness advice completely

Composable Verification Pipeline
Pipeline runs on target dates via smart contract scheduler:

Promotion Check: Admin TLSNotary → HR system → job title verification → automatic reward/punishment
LinkedIn Growth: LLM agent → scrape public profile → connection count → threshold check
Community Rating: Admin TLSNotary → Discord export → random selection → survey dispatch → LLM sentiment analysis → consensus
Marathon Goal: Prediction market resolution + Admin TLSNotary → Strava race results → time verification

Each verification triggers immediate on-chain reward distribution or AI capability modifications based on success/failure.RetryCthe rewards and punishments should be stuff from the essay. these don't make sense.
the admin may have discord access but may not have company access, so we'll have to know what the admin is capable of.let's make this more reasonable. a person is willing to spend 100 total if they meet certain metricsI also want something like a bunch of prediction markets on the reward/punishment combo for whatever agent that's selected that will increase sarah's chance of hitting her metrics most. This seems a bit hard to get enough liquidity on.EditSarah's Goals with AI Companion
Budget: $100 total to spend on incentive alignment
Metrics & Verification Methods
Metric 1: Discord community rates her as "more helpful/collaborative" (3 months)

Verification: Admin TLSNotary (Discord server member list) → random survey → LLM sentiment analysis
Reward: $40 - AI companion gets to influence Sarah's next major life decision
Punishment: AI gets economically tied to a houseplant for 1 month (dies if plant dies)

Metric 2: GitHub shows 100+ commits in new programming language (6 months)

Verification: LLM scrapes public GitHub profile
Reward: $35 - AI gets percentage of Sarah's future coding income for 1 year
Punishment: AI responses limited to disagreeable/challenging mode only

Metric 3: Strava shows consistent 3+ runs per month (6 months)

Verification: Admin TLSNotary into Strava account
Reward: $25 - AI companion gets to choose Sarah's weekend activities
Punishment: AI must advocate for Sarah's competitor's success instead

Prediction Market for Agent Selection
Market Question: "Which AI personality/reward combo will make Sarah most likely to hit 2+ out of 3 metrics?"
Competing agents bid on:

Nurturing coach + plant-entanglement punishment
Challenging mentor + competitor-advocacy punishment
Collaborative partner + disagreeable-mode punishment

Liquidity problem solution: Start with $1000 house money, let people bet with small amounts ($5-50), focus on prediction accuracy rather than large volume.
The winning AI design gets selected based on market confidence, creating economic pressure for good alignment strategies.RetryCsarah wants to pay a bit to figure out an ai companion. there are going to be multiple markets on "if  is selected, then ods of hitting metrics goes up by " and also "if there is no ai companion, ods of hitting metric is _". And then see which one is the highest, and people only get paid for their prediction if they predicted the choice.this is futarchy.can you invoke robin hanson and figure this out? can you give this more details and flesh it outEditYes! This is exactly Robin Hanson's futarchy - "vote on values, bet on beliefs." Sarah votes on what she values (the metrics), the market bets on which AI will best achieve them.
Futarchy Setup for AI Companion Selection
Sarah's Decision: Which AI companion should I choose?
Market Structure (Hanson's conditional prediction markets):
Market 1: "If Sarah chooses Nurturing Coach AI, probability she hits 2+ metrics = ?"
Market 2: "If Sarah chooses Challenging Mentor AI, probability she hits 2+ metrics = ?"
Market 3: "If Sarah chooses Collaborative Partner AI, probability she hits 2+ metrics = ?"
Market 4: "If Sarah chooses NO AI companion, probability she hits 2+ metrics = ?"
The Futarchy Mechanism
Phase 1 - Betting: Markets run for 1 week, people bet on conditional probabilities

Nurturing Coach market settles at 75%
Challenging Mentor market settles at 60%
Collaborative Partner market settles at 85%
No AI market settles at 30%

Phase 2 - Decision: Sarah automatically chooses Collaborative Partner AI (highest predicted success rate)
Phase 3 - Resolution: After 6 months, only bettors in the "Collaborative Partner" market get paid based on actual outcomes
Hanson's Key Insight Applied
The market aggregates distributed information about:

Which personality types work best for Sarah's goals
How effective AI companions are vs. going solo
What incentive structures actually motivate behavior change

Information revelation: Bettors research Sarah's personality, past behavior patterns, and AI companion effectiveness to make informed bets.
Scaling the System
Multiple decisions per person:

"Which reward structure motivates Sarah best?"
"What verification method ensures honest reporting?"
"How much should Sarah budget for alignment?"

Cross-person learning:

"For people like Sarah (introverted engineers), which AI types work best?"
Build prediction models that transfer across similar users

This creates a market for alignment strategies where the wisdom of crowds optimizes individual AI companion selection through revealed preferences and economic incentives.RetryCis there an incentive for people to propose ai companions and reward/punishment structures that will do better than the other proposed ones?EditYes! There's a strong market-making incentive to propose better AI companions:
The Incentive Structure
1. Proposer Advantage

If you propose "Socratic Mentor AI" and it gets the highest predicted success rate, you likely have inside information about why it will work
You can bet heavily on your own proposal before others catch on
First-mover advantage in the prediction market

2. Reputation & Recurring Revenue

Successful AI companion designers build reputation
Sarah and others will pay them to design future companions
Creates a market for alignment consulting

3. Template Licensing

Design reusable AI companion frameworks
Get paid every time someone uses your "Accountability Partner" template
Network effects as successful patterns spread

4. Research Arbitrage

Proposers who understand behavioral psychology, AI capabilities, or specific personality types have edge
They can design companions that markets haven't priced correctly yet

Example Competitive Dynamic
Week 1: Basic proposals (Supportive Coach, Strict Mentor)
Week 2: Someone proposes "Gamified Progress Tracker with Social Accountability"
Week 3: Markets update, new proposal jumps to 90% predicted success
Week 4: Competitors try variations, market makers profit from superior insights
This creates an evolutionary pressure where only the most effective AI companion designs survive, and innovators get rewarded for better alignment strategies.
The futarchy mechanism essentially creates a marketplace for human-AI relationship optimization.RetryCcan we do something like: sara's twitter count is as high as possible and choose models based on that rather than "does it get to over 50k?" how would you structure the prediciton markets?EditYes! You'd structure it as optimization markets rather than binary threshold markets. Here's how:
Continuous Optimization Markets
Market Structure: "If Sarah chooses [AI Type], what will her Twitter follower count be in 6 months?"
Market 1: "If Viral Content AI → Sarah's followers = ?"
Market 2: "If Authentic Voice AI → Sarah's followers = ?"
Market 3: "If Community Builder AI → Sarah's followers = ?"
Market 4: "If No AI → Sarah's followers = ?"
Robin Hanson's Approach
Instead of betting on probability, people bet on expected values:

Viral Content AI market: settles at 15,000 followers
Authentic Voice AI market: settles at 8,500 followers
Community Builder AI market: settles at 22,000 followers
No AI market: settles at 3,000 followers

Sarah chooses: Community Builder AI (highest predicted outcome)
Market Mechanics
Continuous prediction markets where:

Traders buy/sell based on their estimate of final follower count
Market price = crowd's best estimate of outcome
Higher estimates = higher market prices
Sarah picks the AI with highest market price (expected followers)

Payout Structure
After 6 months, if Sarah actually gets 20,000 followers:

Traders who bet "around 20,000" in the Community Builder market get paid
The closer their prediction to reality, the more they earn

This creates incentive to predict exact outcomes rather than just binary success/failure, leading to much more precise AI selection based on optimizing the actual metric Sarah cares about.RetryCdo prediction markets typically have these "exact value" things? I mostly see binary on manifoldEditYou're right! Most prediction markets are binary because they're much easier to trade and resolve.
Current Reality

Manifold, Polymarket, etc.: Mostly "Yes/No" questions
Metaculus: Has some continuous forecasting but it's more complex
Binary is dominant because it's simpler to understand and trade

Why Binary Dominates

Easy liquidity (just bid/ask spread)
Clear resolution (did it happen or not?)
Simple UX for casual traders

Continuous Market Alternatives
Option 1: Bucketed Ranges

"Sarah's followers will be: 0-5k, 5k-10k, 10k-20k, 20k+"
Each bucket is a separate binary market
Pick AI with highest-valued bucket winning

Option 2: Multiple Binary Thresholds

"Will Sarah get >5k followers?"
"Will Sarah get >10k followers?"
"Will Sarah get >20k followers?"
AI that clears most thresholds wins

Option 3: Scoring Rules

Traders submit point estimates
Get rewarded based on accuracy (like Metaculus)
Less liquid but more precise

For your use case, bucketed ranges probably work best - gives you optimization while keeping the familiar binary market structure people actually trade on.RetryCWe're planning to make a symbiont (discord bot) that is aligned to "aug lab going well"! But, we need to decide on some metrics. It's easiest to create yes/no markets, but we can figure out ways around this if y'all have good ideas! So far, I've got: Posts by the official aug lab X account the week after the presentation get over 30k views in total 90% of offical aug lab members present a finished project at mit media lab presentation 80% of members that elect to answer a survey give a positive response to at least 80% the following questions (as verified by opus4 with a simple system prompt) 
* aug lab was the best use of my summer given the choices I had at the time,
* I am proud of the project that I made,
* My job prospects have increased because of aug lab,
* I have made professional connections in aug lab that I expect to keepcome up with composable verification pipelines for this. Make sure they're detailed and accurate
The admin with tlsNotary has access to the aug lab discordmetric 1 should be a composable verification pipeline with an llm call and json
metric 2 can be verification of a market that is on chain
metric 3 can be done with a CVP of an admin running TLSNotary on going to discord, selecting everyone in the residents-general channel, sending a dm to them, collecting that info, another script that sends their response through openai api with simple prompt, and then gets the final percentEdit2 / 2Metric 1: X Account Views Pipeline
